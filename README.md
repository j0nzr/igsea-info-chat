# igsea-info-chat

This Basic Python Chat Application was created during a marked project in computer science at the IGS Enkenbach-Alsenborn, Germany.
Here you've got a short description how to get your chat started.

In the client.py you need to edit the line

```
server = "127.0.0.1"
```
to the ip where your server is located. 

Then start the server using

```
sudo python3 server.py
```

Finally start the client using

```
python3 client.py
```

Have fun at chatting :D
